1) echo "Typo Type,Typo Domain,IP,Country,NameServer,MailServer" > output.csv   //Run urlcrazy for a given URL
urlcrazy [url] | awk -F ' {2,}' '{print $1 " " $2 "," $3 "," $4 "," $5 "," $6}' >> output.csv   :url=item-https://;

2)output_file="output.csv"                                
output1_file="output1.csv"
awk 'NR>=13 && NR%2==1' "$output_file" > "$output1_file"  //To take only lines with URLs

3)awk -F',' '{print $1}' output1.csv > output2.csv   //Take only column with Type & URL

4)awk 'NR == 1 {print "Modification,URL"; next} {url=$NF; $(NF--)=""; modification=$0; print modification "," url}' output2.csv > final_output.csv 

	//Takes the combined output in output2.csv and seperates URL category and URL
